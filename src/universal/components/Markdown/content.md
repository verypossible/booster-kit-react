Markdown in this booster kit is powered by [reactdown](https://andreypopp.github.io/reactdown/).


#### Directives Support
[Directives](https://andreypopp.github.io/reactdown/#Directives) are an extension to the markdown syntax which allows a document to be extended with new block-level constructs.

This `..meta` outputs:

..meta


##### Ref
..ref directives

This `..ref some-anchor` allows you to link to sections like this `[Directives](#some-anchor)`
